# Go Fundamentals

This is a simple repository that contains two short projects made in Go, which can be used to demonstrate the capabilities of Go for the web. These are very beginner-friendly project, and the main motive of them is to give experience into how working with Go applications looks like in general.

The projects are:

- [CryptoMasters](./cryptomasters/): A simple CLI to fetch the rates of crypocurrencies
- [Museum](./museum/): A web server about a fictional museum
